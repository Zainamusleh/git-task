1. Purpose of Git Commands:

- git status: shows the current status of files (modified, staged, untracked).
- git init: initializes a new Git repository.
- git commit: saves staged changes with a message.
- git push: uploads local commits to GitHub.

2. Ahmed's claim about skipping `git add`:
I disagree. `git add` lets you choose which changes to include. Without it, youâ€™d have less control.

3. Code Hosting Providers:
a. GitLab and Bitbucket
b. Features: backups, branching, pull requests, access control, CI/CD.
c. True. A team can self-host version control tools.

4. `git push -u origin main`:
The `-u` flag sets the default remote and branch, so future `git push` or `git pull` commands can be used without specifying branch names.
